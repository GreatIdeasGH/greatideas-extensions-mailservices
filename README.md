Implementing the sending of emails using the Microsoft Graph SDK and SendGrid in .NET 6.0 and .NET 7.0.    

## Getting Started
* For the Microsoft Graph SDK, you need to create an Azure AD application and grant the application the permissions to send emails on behalf of the user. You can find more information about this [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-v2-user?view=graph-rest-1.0). 


* For SendGrid, you need to create an API key. You can find more information about this [here](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/email-api-quickstart-for-c).
